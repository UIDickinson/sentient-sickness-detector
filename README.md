This application uses a **CSV dataset** of disease-symptom records loaded from attached_assets. The exact size depends on the loaded CSV file. The ML engine predicts diseases based on symptom combinations, and dobby-unhinged-llama-3-3-70b-new translates technical predictions into empathetic, easy-to-understand language for dog owners.

## Key Features

### âœ… Fully Implemented
- **Symptom Autocomplete** - Real-time search of symptoms from veterinary dataset
- **ML Disease Prediction** - Statistical analysis of veterinary records produces confidence scores
- **Conversational AI** - dobby-unhinged-llama-3-3-70b-new translates technical predictions to friendly language
- **Chat Interface** - Empathetic responses with follow-up question capability
- **Detailed Predictions** - Toggle between simple and technical views
- **CSV Data Integration** - Based on disease-symptom relationship data

### ðŸ”„ Available for Extension
- **Advanced ML Pipeline** - Enhanced model training and persistence
- **Docker Containerization** - Easy deployment with docker-compose
- **Additional UI Components** - Many shadcn/ui components available but unused

### Further ideas that can be added to this project
